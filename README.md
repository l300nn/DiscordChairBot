Welcome to my little chairbot, what does it do let me tell you.
The biggest feature of this bot is that it will just delete anything expect the one emoji that you can pick, another thing is that it will send that selected emoji if it does delete something.
You will need to provide your own "config.json" file with your own bot token.

The file should look like that

{
  "token": "Your discord bot token"
}
